# core100
The CORE100 app - a course page prototype. 

This is a UI/UX prototype for the CORE100 course experience.
It intentionally contains no authentication, backend logic, or live Capsim integration.

All external systems (Inbox, CapsimCore, Reports, Caprai) are accessed via explicit handoff pages.

This repo is a design reference, not production code.
